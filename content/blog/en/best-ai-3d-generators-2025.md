## The State of AI 3D Generation in 2025

Before diving into individual platforms, let's understand the current technological landscape:

### Key Technological Advances

**Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) Evolution**
The foundational technology has matured significantly, enabling more accurate depth estimation and surface reconstruction from single images.

**Diffusion Models for 3D**
Building on the success of image generation, diffusion-based approaches now create coherent 3D structures with unprecedented detail.

**Multi-View Consistency**
Modern systems maintain geometric consistency across all viewing angles, eliminating the "2.5D" artifacts that plagued earlier solutions.

**Texture Synthesis Breakthroughs**
AI can now generate photorealistic textures that seamlessly wrap around complex geometries, complete with proper UV mapping.
